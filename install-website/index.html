                <h4 class="qes"> Q1. What is My Guard ?</h4>
                <p class="ans"> - My Guard is a mobile application coming with a security camera and security base
                    station. User can install the camera and power-up the base station at a secure position. Using the
                    application can help users to monitor their home, their office or even their own secret room. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="q2">
                <h4 class="qes"> Q2. What will I get in the package?</h4>
                <p class="ans"> - one Raspberry Pi (security base station), one or two Bluetooth sensor, one USB camera,
                    and
                    our fantstic mobile application (MyGuard) are all included</p>
            </div>
            <div class="q3">
                <h4 class="qes"> Q3. How can I install My Guard?</h4>
                <p class="ans"> - just scan the QR code on the package and you can press the Android icon to download
                    the application directly on your mobile device. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="q4">
                <h4 class="qes"> Q4. What do I do after receive the package?</h4>
                <p class="ans"> - It is easy to set it up: plugin the Raspberry Pi into a power source via a mirco-sub
                    cable, connect the usb camera with the Raspberry Pi via the usb port, attach the bluetooth motion
                    sensor to your desierd location (works best on horizontal surfaces).Lastly, dowonload and
                    register your account on the MyGuard application on your Android phone. <br> That's it; you can now
                    ready to use your system!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="q5">
                <h4 class="qes"> Q5. How does it work?</h4>
                <p class="ans"> - After you've completed the setup, all you have to do now is turn on the Raspberry Pi's
                    power source (it will take about 1-2 minutes for the Raspberry Pi to boot up), then turn on the
                    Bluetooth motion sensor(s) using the on/off switch on the sensor (which should be in your desk
                    drawer, locker, or wherever you decided to put it), and you're done; Now all you have to do is wait
                    for someone to open your drawer*, and the USB camera will snap a photo of them and send it to the
                    'myGuard' mobile app. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="q6">
                <h4 class="qes"> Q6. What is the facial recognition, how can I use it?</h4>
                <p class="ans"> - Following your purchase, we will send you a connection to the Amazon Web Services
                    website along with login credentials to use the facial recognition feature. Simply log in and go to
                    the 'Amazon S3' bucket (type 's3' into the website's search box and click on the first result). Open
                    the 'add-to-collection' bucket and upload photo(s) of your face and/or any other individual who uses
                    this system from your account (take 4-5 pictures of face for best results). The facial recognition
                    feature will start operating the next time you connect in your Raspberry Pi for power. In your
                    'myGuard' app, you'll now see photographs with the labels 'known' and 'unknown,' as well as the date
                    and time they were taken. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="q7">
                <h4 class="qes"> Q7. What does is it mean by ‘known’ and ‘unknown’ in the photos label?</h4>
                <p class="ans"> - The images of the individual(s) you uploaded to the amazon web services website's
                    'add-to-collection' bucket will now be referred to as 'known' person(s), hence the label beneath the
                    picture you received in your phone. This simply means that if a 'known' person(s) unlocks your
                    drawer*, you will not receive a push notification on your phone (you will still be able to see this
                    picture in your app as it stores historical data for some time). Only individuals who are not
                    recognised by the facial recognition software will receive a push notification on your phone
                    (unauthorised people). </p>
            </div>
            <div class="q8">
                <h4 class="qes"> Q8. How long will the battery last on my Bluetooth motion sensor?</h4>
                <p class="ans"> - We'll throw in a new battery with your order, which should last roughly a month*. The
                    battery may be quickly replaced and is readily available in your local supermarket or online, as
                    well as being reasonably priced. If you're unsure which battery to get, check at the battery code on
                    your Bluetooth motion sensor and search for that. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="q9">
                <h4 class="qes"> Q9. Why is the micro-usb cable not provided in the box?</h4>
                <p class="ans"> - The 'myGuard' system does not include a power adapter or a micro-usb cable as part of
                    our efforts to meet our environmental goals.
                    <br>
                    We recommend using your existing micro-USB cable and power adapter, as long as they are compatible
                    with this Raspberry Pi model. However, if you need new power adapters or cables, you may find them
                    online or in your local store.
