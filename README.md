## Background

Traditional surveillance camera records video stream continuously, it imposes a heavy burden on storage and network infrastructure. It is also laborious to retrieve those videos, once an incident, such as a theft of an item has been reported.


## Project Description
We want to develop an IoT-based surveillance system using 3 devices, a set of Bluetooth sensors, a base station, and a web camera.
The user may install the sensor into or within equipment or furniture such as a desk drawer and mount the camera at the right location to observe the surveillance region. In this example, if an unauthorised person opens the drawer, the sensor can be used to notify the base station, and subsequently, the base station instructs the networked web camera to snap a photo. The warning notification and the photo can be shared in real-time with the user via a phone App.
The system should be scalable, able to cover a typical office where the sensors are can communicate with the single base station.
